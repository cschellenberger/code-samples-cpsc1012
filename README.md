# Code Samples for CPSC1012

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/cschellenberger/code-samples-cpsc1012/main?urlpath=lab)

Primarily, this repo was created to test running a C# .ipynb with the proper .NET kernels. I added the `?urlpath=lab` to the end of the binder URL as stated [CreateBinder.md] (https://github.com/dotnet/interactive/blob/main/docs/CreateBinder.md) interactive docs.
